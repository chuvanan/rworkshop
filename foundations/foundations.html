- R is a free programming language and software environment for statistical 
computing and graphics.

- Misconception: Many think of R as a statistics system. In fact, R is a true computer
language and can be considered as an environment within which statistical techniques 
are implemented.

R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping
semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers in 1976, while at Bell
Labs.

Ross Ihaka &amp; Robert Gentleman introduce R to the world in 1993.

    fah &lt;- (x - 32) * 5 / 9
    paste0(x, " Fahrenheit is equal to ", fah, " Celcius")

---

# Naming convention

--

- .large[Variable and function names should be lowercase]

--

- .large[Use an underscore (_) to separate words within a name]

--

- .large[Generally, variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs]

```r
# Good

# Bad
