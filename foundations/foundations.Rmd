- R is a free programming language and software environment for statistical 
computing and graphics.

- Misconception: Many think of R as a statistics system. In fact, R is a true computer
language and can be considered as an environment within which statistical techniques 
are implemented.

R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping
semantics inspired by Scheme. S was created by John Chambers in 1976, while at Bell
Labs.

Ross Ihaka & Robert Gentleman introduce R to the world in 1993.

--

- .large[Variable and function names should be lowercase]

--

- .large[Use an underscore (_) to separate words within a name]
